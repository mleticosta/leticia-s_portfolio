# Data Analysis - Coffee

**This is my first project as a Data Analyst. I decided to pick a subject that is a passion in my day-to-day life - coffee.**

## The process until the final dashboard includes: 
1. Cleaning the dataset - verifying for duplicates and missing values.
2. Using basic formulas such as VLOOKUP, IF, and SUM 
3. Creating new columns in the 'orders' sheet to facilitate the analysis.
4. Converting data to a table format.
5. Inserting a Pivot Table from which the dashboard is created.

*Thank you for reading this! I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed creating it. Your feedback is highly appreciated, and I look forward to connecting with you and hearing your thoughts.*
